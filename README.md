**Intended use**
- Primary intended uses:
  - Matching customer names with lists of “bad actors”, which is a requirement for all financial institutions and a difficult problem to solve.
  - Name matching can be used to find a certain product that a customer might want to purchase (Product names online).
  - It can also be used when trying to find a local branch (Address).
  - Primary intended users: Financial institutions.
  - Out-of-scope use cases: This is solely for educational purpose for learning. Any use beyond an educational example is out-of-scope.
- Describe the business value of your group's best model
  - The best model is used for screening the customer names against watchlists of known financial criminals, terrorists, and entities subject to sanctions violations (“bad actors”). If there is a match, the bank may choose to not execute the transaction or onboard the customer.
**Training data**
- State the source of training data
  - U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Office of Foreign Assets Control - Sanctions Programs and Information https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sdn.csv

  - 70/30.  
- State the number of rows in training
  - Train data rows = 700, columns = 5. Train data rows = 300, columns = 5
- Define the meaning of all training data columns
  - Data dictionary:
 
|Name|Modeling Role|	Measurement Level|	Description|
-----|-------------|------------------|------------|
**Test Name Variation**|	target|	string| name variation after transforming the orignal watchlist name|
**Theme** |	imput |	string|	broad categorization of the test name variation|
**Category**|input|	string|	type of transformation undergone by test name variation|
**Subcategory**|	input|	string|	type of exact transformation undegone by the test name variation|
**Entity Type**|	input|	string|	whether the orignal watchlist name is a city, country, entity, individual or a vessel name|
**Orignal Watchlist Name**|	input| string|	orignal watchlist name|
  
- Define the meaning of all engineered columns
  
**Evaluation data**
- State the source of evaluation (or test) data
  - Test Case generated by the Client.
- State the number of rows in evaluation (or test) data
  - 641 (without the header).
- State any differences in columns between training and evaluation (or test) data
  - Rec. No: Index
  - List Name: OFAC list Name arranged in First Name Last Name order
  - Orignal List Name: Orignal Name from the OFAC List
  - # of TPs: Number of matches or True Positives found in the OFAC List for corresponsding List Name or Orignal List name.
  - Volume: True Positives plus False Positives generated by a Name Variation on looking up the OFAC List

**Model details**
- State the columns used as inputs in your group's best remediated model
  'Rec. No', 'Theme',	'Category',	'Subcategory', 'Entity Type',	'List Name',	'Original List Name',	'Name Variation',	'# of TPs', 'Volume', '# of TPs(Obtained)',	'Digits Removed',	'Name Variation First Last',	'Name Variation Clean',	'VOHs(Cosine)',	'TP predicted by Cosine'
- State the columns used as targets in your group's best remediated model

- State the type of your group's best remediated model
  - Cosine Simalarity.
- State the software used to implement your group's best remediated model
  - 'pandas','jellyfish', 'matplotlib', 'scikit-learn', 'scipy', 'seaborn', 'numpy'
- State the version of the modeling software for your group's best remediated model
  - 'pandas 1.4.2', 'jellyfish 0.9.0', 'matplotlib 3.5.2', 'scikit-learn 1.0.2', 'scipy 1.8.1', 'seaborn 0.11.2', ' numpy 1.22.4'
- State the hyperparameters or other settings of your group's best remediated model
  - Cosine Similarity(cutoff:0.5) with Levenshtein Distance(cutoff1:15, cutoff2:2)
**Quantitative analysis**

- State the metrics used to evaluate your group's best remediated model
  - True Positive percentage(TP%) and Volume of Hits(VOHs).
- State the values of the metrics for training, validation, and evaluation (or test) data evaluation (or test) metrics come from the most recent class full evaluation results
  - Training:
   - Cosine: TP% - 90.12%, VOHs - 2193
   - Double Metaphone: TP% - 97.93%, VOHs - 23900
   - Soundex: TP% - 95.69%, VOHs - 33267
